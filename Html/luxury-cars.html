                <h1>Aston Martin Vanquish</h1>
                <p>The <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_Vanquish">Aston Martin Vanquish</a></strong> is a grand tourer introduced by British luxury automobile manufacturer Aston Martin in 2001 as a successor to the Aston Martin Vantage (1993). The first-generation
                    of the "V12 Vanquish," designed by Ian Callum and unveiled at the 2001 Geneva Motor Show, was produced from 2001 to 2007 as the flagship of the marque. The concept car,
                    known as "Project Vantage" and the first Aston Martin design wholly styled by Callum, was built by the Ford Motor Company with craftsman Dilip Chhabria to display the
                    company's vision for a future sports car to represent Aston Martin after the discontinuation of the Virage-based Vantage. The V12 Vanquish closely resembled
                    the concept car, and featured carbon fibre and alloy construction, Aston Martin's most powerful V12 engine, and host of new technologies. A specially
                    modified V12 Vanquish was driven by James Bond in the 2002 film Die Another Day. In 2004, a mildly updated version of the first-generation model
                    named "V12 Vanquish S" was introduced featuring a more highly tuned engine and more track-oriented ride and handling. The V12 Vanquish was indirectly
                    replaced by the DBS after 2007.</p>
